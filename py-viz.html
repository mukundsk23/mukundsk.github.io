          <h3>Bar Graph for total number of games released by genere</h3>

          <img src="images/bar-graph-genre.PNG" alt="seconds" width="1000" height="550">

          <p>This graph shows us the which genre sold the most number of games. Actions games dominate this section followed by Sports and Misc. 
              An interesting category is the Misc. which include games like Deal or No Deal, games related to astrology etc.</p>

              We can see that towards the end, action games dominated the market, with more and more publishers releasing action games and the 
            games in turn topping the charts. Games in this genre would be games like Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Counter Strike, Red Dead Redemption
            , God of War etc.<br>
        For 2006 we can see that the trend of action games is broken by a sports games which is FIFA 2006.

          <h3>Bar Graph for top 3 revenue generating genres in United states, Japan, Europe and rest of the world</h3>
          <img src="images/rev-per-reg.PNG" alt="seconds" width="1000" height="550">

         <p>From the plot we can see that European Union, North America and even rest of the world follow the same trend i.e. action games
             generate the most revenue!!! Around 500 million$ for European Union and 900 million$ for North America and around 180 million$ in rest of the world. 
             Followed by Sports and Shooting games.<br>
            In Japan we see that role playing games top the genere list.
                There are many reasons why role-playing games are more popular than FPS games in Japan. 
                One major reason is that Japan has a long, proud history of role-playing games, such as the “Dragon Quest” or the “Final Fantasy” games. The country’s past RPG successes continue to perpetuate the cycle. Another reason is that FPS games were born and bred on the PC in America during the 1990s — a time when Japan was completely enraptured with RPGs on home consoles.
                 Since RPGs were so popular at that time in Japan, domestic video-game-makers never really put any effort into developing their own FPS titles
