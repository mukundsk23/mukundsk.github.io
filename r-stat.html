            Such cleansing cases is somewhat subjective, so explain your process and reasoning for identifying aberrancies in the data and
             removing them. State how many cases you are left with in your random sample after cleansing.  This will be your primary data set for analysis.</h1>

          <h3>Knowing the variables</h3>
          <p>

            This file contains information on 1,705,805 taxi cab trips in the City of Chicago during 2016.  The data was taken from kaggle.com.  
<br>
            Variables in this data set are:
            <br>
            a.	taxi_id: a unique identifier for each individual taxi cab.<br>
            b.	trip_seconds:  the number of seconds elapsed during the trip.<br>
            c.	trip_miles:  the number of miles logged during the trip.<br>
            d.	fare:  the base fare charged to the customer for the trip.<br>
            e.	tips:  the tip given by the customer to the driver for the trip.<br>
            f.	tolls:  any surcharges for road or bridge tolls incurred during the trip.<br>
            g.	extras:  charges for any incidentals requested by the customer.<br>
            h.	trip_total:  the total charge to the customer for the trip.<br>
            i.	payment_type:  the method of payment used by the customer.  This includes cash, credit card, and several other methods of payment jointly classed as “other”.<br>

    There are a few records wherein trip_seconds is 0 and trip_fair is some positive value.
    This is a case of INCORRECT DATA or missing value, since if the trip_seconds are 0,
    ideally there shouldn't be any fare. So cleaning those values.

        <p>
          The sample_data_correlation matrix shows the matrix of correlation.
It measure the linear relation and strength between two variables
For example the cor between trip_seconds and trip_miles is 0.0997. It is a positive number
it mean that if trip_seconds increases, trip_miles also increases.
Another example as per the cor, the relation between tips and trip_miles is negative,
it means as the trip_miles increases the tips decreases or vice versa
The best correlation is between fare and trip_miles.

        <h2>Building Models</h2>
        <img src="images/image014.png" alt="Extras" width="300" height="300">
        <p>This linear model was built using <strong>fare</strong> as the dependent variable and <strong>trip_seconds, trip_miles, and payment_type</strong>
          as dependent variables. Keeping the <i>confience interval at 95%</i>, we get the values, the confidence interval values<br>
          for (Intercept)  -2.10607443 to 2.50346298, <br>
         for trip_seconds  0.01325227 to  0.01718661,<br>
          for trip_miles   -0.02324120 to  0.02733108 and<br> 
          for payment_type   0.49333928 to  5.81493280<br>
          The equation for fare would be<br>
          <strong><i>fare = 0.198694 + 0.0152194 * trip_seconds + 0.0020449 * trip_miles + 3.154136 * payment_type</i></strong><br>
          <strong>for every change in trip_seconds, the fare changes by 0.0152194, and its p value is significantly small (less than 2e-16), 
          hence we reject the null hypothesis,</strong><br>
          <strong>for every change in trip_miles, the fare changes by 0.0020449, but its p value is significantly large(0.8723),

          <strong>for every change in payment, the fare changes by 3.154136, and its p value is significantly small (0.0209), 
          hence we reject the null hypothesis, </strong><br>
          <strong> for the intercept, if the miles and seconds travelled is 0, and payment is also 0, then the total fare
          should be 0.198694, which doesnt make any sense. Also its pvalue is significantly lare (0.8640),
          hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis since there is not enough evidence.</strong><br>
          Also the value for R-sq is 0.794 and Adj R-sq is 0.7851 which tells us the percentage that the three independent
          variables describe the dependent one.

<strong>          In case of trip_seconds, if the value for trip_seconds changes, the fare also changes by 0.015615. Its p value

          <strong>In case of trip_miles, if the value for trip_miles changes, the fare also changes by 0.001569. Its p value

  <p>The "P&O Residuals" plot shows that the residuals are not equivalent to variance .
    There are many outliers in the plot as well.
    Hence we can say that the outliers do not affect the accuracy of the model

<h3>    Since there are a lot of outliers in the plot we check for leverage.
We expell the points with high leverage </h3>

  <p>From the plot we can see there are around 4 - 5 points which can be considered as outliers.
    By using Which function, returns the indices of the logical object when it is TRUE.
    </p>
  

<p>
Using the following R code, we get the levrage points : <br>
  leverage_points = which(leverage>3*mean(leverage)) <br>

  Output:<br>
  2 19 20 24 36<br>
  <strong>There are 5 outliers, the points are '2, 19, 20, 24, 36' are out of the leverage level
  here are the details of the points which are inappropriate for the model.</strong>

  <p>We can see we get the same values after removing the outliers even for R-sq = 0.9042 and Adj R-sq = 0.9, 
    i.e. both the models are quite similar.<br>
    
  <strong>The equation for fare would be
   fare = 2.6668736 + trip_seconds * 0.0064833 + trip_miles * 1.6087559 - miles_sq * 0.0035525 </strong>
    
  All the p values are significantly low hence we reject the null hypothesis

<h2>Testing the model on a test set</h2>
<img src="images/image032.png" alt="Extras" width="300" height="300">
<p>
  Using the best model on the new dataset, we get a R-sq = 0.9539 and Adj R-sq = 0.952.<br>
The value for Intercept is 3.1029464 and its p value is 2.37e-06.<br>
The value for trip_seconds is 0.0080489 and its p value is 7.98e-16.<br>
The value for trip_miles is 1.1125162 and its p value is 7.22e-08<br>
The value for trip_miles_sq is 0.0173281 and its p value is 0.00291 <br>
Hence in all the cases, we Reject the Null Hypothesis.
<strong>The equation for fare would be
 fare = 3.1029464 + 0.0080489 * trip_seconds + 1.1125162 * trip_miles + 0.0173281 * trip_miles_sq</strong><br>
If trip_seconds changes, fare changes by 0.0080489,
If trip_miles changes, fare changes by 1.1125162,
 If trip_seconds changes, fare changes by 0.0173281
